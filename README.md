## CS-250-T5574 Software Development Lifecycle

*These prompts are some of the “essential questions” for the Computer Science program. You will encounter these questions in different courses throughout the program. They are open-ended and meant to help you engage with “big ideas” in the field.*

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpert user needs by jumping into the users shoes, well figuratively. I ask questions.  I watch processes.  I collect data. I try and create a story that explains thier goals. I am much more focused on what they want to accomplish rather then how they do it today. That is not to say how is not important, it just is not first in the story.

### How do I approach developing programs? 

I tend to find way to improve processes. I look at the big process and break it down into small parts, then I build the small parts into a big system.

### What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

* User stories
* Story points
* Backlog and acklog refinement
* Sprints
* Stand up meetings
* Sprint review
* Sprint retrospective
* Burndown charts
* and more as I continue to learn

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

* Be a life learner
* Give more then you take
* Keep you commitments
* Be honest about your abilities and shortcomings
* Identify road blocks
* No useless complaining - bring a solution with each problem
